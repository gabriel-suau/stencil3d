# Ideas of possible optimizations

## Loop interchange

* Goal : Optimize data locality
* Difficulty : Easy AF

## Space tiling

* Goal : Further optimize data locality
* Difficulty : Medium

## Space-time tiling

* Goal : Further optimize data locality by starting to compute values of the next time iteration before the current iteration is finished.
* Difficulty : Hard AF
